Description: |
 Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique ids (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. See RFC 4122 for more information.
