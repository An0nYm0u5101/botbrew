 Development files for the GLib library
 GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for things such as trees, hashes, lists, and strings. It is a useful general-purpose C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME. This package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0, as only it includes the header files and static libraries (optionally) needed for compiling.
Depends: libglib2.0, libmusl-dev, libffi-dev, libpcre-dev
