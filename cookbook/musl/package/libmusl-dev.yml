 development files for libmusl
 libmusl is a wrapper library for Bionic, Android's C library. Based on musl, libmusl provides many functions that Bionic lacks. musl, pronounced like "mussel" or "muscle", is an implementation of the C/POSIX standard library intended for use on Linux-based systems, licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1 or later. musl is a new general-purpose implementation of the C library. It is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and hopefully correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety.
