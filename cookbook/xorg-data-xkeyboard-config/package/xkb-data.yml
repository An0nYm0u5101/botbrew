 X Keyboard Extension (XKB) configuration data
 This package contains configuration data used by the X Keyboard Extension (XKB), which allows selection of keyboard layouts when using a graphical interface. Every X11 vendor provides its own XKB data files, so keyboard layout designers have to send their layouts to several places. The xkeyboard-config project has been launched at FreeDesktop in order to provide a central repository that could be used by all vendors.
