 Open PacKaGe Management System
 Opkg is a lightweight package management system. It is written in C and resembles apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for use on embedded Linux devices and is used in this capacity in the OpenEmbedded and OpenWrt projects. Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its memory usage, despite its buggy ipkg ancestry. As best it can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms to a subset of debian's policy manual regarding control files.
