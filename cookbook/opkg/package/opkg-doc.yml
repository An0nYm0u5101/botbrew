Description: |
 Open PacKaGe Management System
 Opkg is a lightweight package management system. It is written in C and resembles apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for use on embedded Linux devices and is used in this capacity in the OpenEmbedded and OpenWrt projects.
 .
 Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its memory usage, despite its buggy ipkg ancestry. As best it can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms to a subset of debian's policy manual regarding control files.
